#. Implement 'Employee <-> Client' Access Relationships
    - Client model should introduce a new enum field
        -enum has_access_to  [:all, :some, :all_except]
    - A new table ClientEmployeeAssociation should be created
        -only has_access_to relation is recorded in the table
            -Eg: EmployeeId <-> ClientId
    - As per the has_access_to_field,
        -if :all, directly get all clients  (no joins whatsoever)
        -if :some, Employee <-> ClientEmployeeAssociation <-> Client (INNER JOIN)
        -if :all_except, Employee <-> ClientEmployeeAssociation <-> Client (OUTER JOIN)
            -Note: The table ClientEmployeeAssociation doesn't hold any all_except relationship. Therefore, the OUTER JOIN.
    - When a conflicting association is introduced, hard-delete the previous association from the table, and record the new association.
