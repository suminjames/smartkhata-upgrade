-Deal Cancel
    - happens 'mysteriously', and is apparently nobody's fault but nepse's glitch
    - no party financially liable

-Closeout
    - if a buy/sale order doesn't goes through due to insufficient quantity of 
      share transaction, `closeout` takes place.
    - by law, closeout triggering seller should pay 20% of the 
      insufficient quantity's worth (through the seller broker) to the affected 
      buyer (through the buyer broker) via Nepse.
        -however, there are `other ways` closeouts are settled.
    - 'closeout for sales transactions' seen in CM report in 'Closeout Amount' column
    - 'closeout for purchase transactions' seen in  <TODO>

-CGT and CapitalGain
    -only for sold transactions
    -when floorsheet is uploaded, cgt is not allocated for both buy and sell transactions.
    -however, during payout upload, the sold transactions will be updated with cgt and capitalgain (both available in
    the uploaded file itself.)

-DP Fee
    -calculated during floorsheet upload
    -NRs. 25 for each unique ISIN's transaction type
        -i.e., NRs 25 for x number of NIBL(s) bought, and separate NRs. 25 for y number of NIBL(s) sold
    -so 25 is separately divided (for bought or sold) among number of NIBL(s).
    -in the event of transaction cancellation, adjustment of dp fee is required.
