NOTE! Be cautious of active-record callbacks, which aren't very apparent while skimming the code.

Some information about the cheque entry implementation:
- voucher has a callback after_save that assigns cheque
- if (internal) bank to bank transfer,
    -the beneficiary name is supposed to be the tenant's full name.
    -it is considered as payment
- if voucher has multiple particulars, the beneficiary name is (assigned) as the first person.


-multiple settlements only when voucher type is payment/receipt, and settlement type is default.
-single settlement when voucher type is payment/receipt, and settlement type is not default
