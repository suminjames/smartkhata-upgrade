        - test sidekiq is working
            - can be done by visiting APP_URL/sidekiq
    - change the existing history size of the bash (for user `deploy`) to be very big
        - in /home/deploy/.bashrc, modify existing history configuration to

    - To populate(or update) the menu
        - bundle exec rake menu:update_list
            - note:

#. For checking correctness
    - Check 'NEPSE Purchase' ledger for that particular date
        - for now, this ledger should only have credit entries
            - after closeout feature has been introduced, it will also have debit entries
        - check number of particulars
